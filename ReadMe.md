# ObjectOriented-basics

This project illustrates fundamental object-oriented programming concepts in C++ by implementing three classes: Tdzialania (Arithmetic Operations), Tpracownik (Employee), and Tstudent (Student).

## Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ObjectOriented-basics.git
   ```
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable generated after compilation.

## Usage

The program presents a menu-driven interface with the following options:

- Perform arithmetic operations (Task 2.2)
- Calculate employee's remuneration (Task 2.3)
- Calculate student's average grade (Task 2.4)

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the compiled executable.
3. Execute the program by running the compiled binary file.

## Example Usage

```
$ ./compiled_binary
```

## Functionality

### Tdzialania (Arithmetic Operations)

- Allows input of two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

### Tpracownik (Employee)

- Takes input for employee details such as name, hourly wage, hours worked, and date of employment.
- Calculates and displays the employee's earnings based on the provided information.

### Tstudent (Student)

- Accepts student information including name and three grades.
- Calculates and shows the student's average grade.
- Warns if the student receives an invalid grade.

## Note

Ensure proper input format adherence for accurate calculations and results.
